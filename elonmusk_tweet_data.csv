@jeffskoll,"Hi folks.    There was an article in today’s NY Times that reviewed X under the tenure of @elonmusk and @lindayaX (Linda Yaccarino).  It is about a year since Elon hired her to run the company.  The article mostly focuses on financial performance.  In my view, X has become a pleasure to use this year.  I was not a fan of Twitter and generally stayed away from it.  But this year, it has become a daily go to for me.  I like the transparency and the opportunities to say what is on my mind and gauge what the reactions may be.  While not all of the responses are pleasant, at least they are unfiltered and do capture the ethos of free speech that Elon wanted to bring to life.  I’m curious what others think?  1). Is the platform now better as a user experience since Elon / Linda took over?  2). Is the platform about the same in your view?  3). Are things not as good?  If not, what would you do to change things?  Thanks for any thoughts.",6642,755,"Jul 27, 2024 · 12:59 PM UTC"

@SpaceX,Falcon 9 returns to flight and delivers 23 @Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit,18480,1619,"Jul 27, 2024 · 7:09 AM UTC"
@johnkrausphotos,"FALCON 9 RETURNS TO FLIGHT  This morning’s launch of 23 Starlink satellites, seen here transiting the Moon, was the first since a July 11 second stage anomaly during a Starlink mission from California grounded the Falcon fleet. In just 15 days, SpaceX identified and resolved the issue and now has returned to flight. It’s difficult to contextualize how impressive that is. Even working through an anomaly investigation, that turnaround far exceeds the regular launch frequency of every other launch provider in the world.  It is also an important reminder that spaceflight is never easy and never routine. Pushing the boundaries of physics, spaceflight is unforgiving, and the smallest hardware deficiency can wreak havoc to an entire mission. The small part that failed on the July 11 mission was part of a redundant sensor system, but the downstream effect of this failure prevented a clean ignition for the second stage’s second burn, resulting in the stage unable to circularize its orbit and deploy the Starlink satellites. The short-term resolution was to simply delete the part!  Even as rocket launches become more and more frequent and garner less and less fanfare, there remains countless hard-working individuals and teams making that so. Congrats to all on the hard work.  Sometimes you don’t realize how much something means to you until it’s gone. Welcome back Falcon 9 🚀",17835,1573,"Jul 27, 2024 · 5:57 AM UTC"

@Intrstngthings,"The Oort Cloud lies far beyond Pluto and the most distant edges of the Kuiper Belt. While the planets of our solar system orbit in a flat plane, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell surrounding the Sun, planets and Kuiper Belt Objects. It's like a big, thick bubble around our solar system, made of icy, comet-like objects. The Oort Cloud's icy bodies can be as large as mountains – and sometimes larger.  Because the orbits of long-period comets – which take more than 200 years to orbit the Sun – are so extremely long, scientists suspect that the Oort Cloud is the source of most of those comets. For example, comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring, which made a very close pass by Mars in 2014, will not return to the inner solar system for about 740,000 years.  The distance from the Sun to the Oort Cloud is so enormous that it’s useful to describe it not in the more common units of miles or kilometers, but astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance between Earth and the Sun. Pluto’s elliptical orbit carries it as close as 30 AU from the Sun, and as far as 50 AU. The inner edge of the Oort Cloud, however, is thought to be between 2,000 and 5,000 AU from the Sun. The outer edge might be 10,000 or even 100,000 AU from the Sun – that's one-quarter to halfway between the Sun and the nearest neighboring star.

@Jason,"I’m 100% in support of adults pursuing whatever gender they please, by whatever means they like.   More power to you!   However, we will look back at this time, when doctors and “professionals” pressured parents to perform surgery and give hormones to *children*, with great shame and regret.    The detransition stories are just starting, and they are devastating.   These stories always include the parents and children being bullied into making irreversible decisions.  They make decisions they don’t fully understand but are told will solve a complex problem. However, in most cases, this “problem” is solved best with love, compassion, counseling, and time.   Adolescence is challenging 100% of the time, as we all have experienced.   Imagine your darkest and most confusing moment as a teenager. Now, imagine a group of authorities telling you that your gender confusion causes all your pain and that you can solve all of that pain with surgery and hormones.   Now imagine the state of California acting to hide this child’s struggle from their parents — and then pursuing a gender transition covertly with the child.   That is the crime that is happening right now.   We don’t let kids smoke vapes or drink until they are fully informed of the ramifications of those decisions as adults  — yet we put them on puberty blockers and have them do surgery to change their gender as teenagers?   What is the rush?   There isn’t one, so they tell the parents, “Your child will kill themselves if they don’t transition.”  This is pure evil.   There are no parents who agree with this, there are only bullied and confused parents… and that needs to end now.   I say this with unlimited compassion and love for any child or family dealing with gender dysphoria.   Please speak up parents.   https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1815501775191064813/video/1",36673,5911,"Jul 22, 2024 · 10:56 PM UTC"
